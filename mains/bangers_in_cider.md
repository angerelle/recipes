# Bangers in Cider

Serves 2 adults, 2 smallish children - increase the number of sausages for bigger children/more grown ups.

## Ingredients

* 6 sausages, pork and apple are nice, but any nice herby ones will do
* pack cubetti pancetta or some streaky bacon snipped up with scissors
* 1 tbsp plain flour
* vegetable oil
* 1 large carrot, cut in half lengthwise and sliced (or diced - this isn't cooked as long as a proper stew so don't cut too big so that the carrot gets a chance to soften up)
* 1 onion, diced
* couple of sprigs of thyme
* 250ml nice cider
* 5 juniper berries
* bay leaf

## Method

1. Fry the pancetta/bacon in the oil in a casserole/heavy based pan
2. When the fat starts to run, put in the sausages and brown all over
3. When the sausages have browned remove them and add the onions and carrots, soften for 5 minutes or so.
4. Stir in the plain flour
5. Return the sausages to the pan, add the herbs and juniper then add enough cider to cover comfortably.  Stir well so that the flour doesn't cause any lumps
6. Simmer, covered, for 30-45 minutes
7. Season to taste and serve with mash or rice and a glass of cider.
