# Storecupboard cream of tomato soup

This is **way** better than tinned tomato soup and takes literally minutes to 
make.

## Ingredients

* Carton of passata - try to get one which is *just* tomatoes
* 1pt chicken stock - home made if you have it, ready made in a pouch if not
* Good splash of double or single cream
* Basil or rosemary (optional)
* 1/2 tsp of sugar (or to taste)
* salt and pepper

## Method

1. Empty the passata into a saucepan. If you don't have passata then a whizzed up tin of tomatoes will do at a push.
2. Add enough stock to get the consistency how you like it.
3. Stir in the sugar and season.  If you are using rosemary, add it before heating.
4. Heat until hot.
5. Take off the heat.  If you're using basil, add it at this point.
6. Stir in the cream.
